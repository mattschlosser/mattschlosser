# About Matt

Hi. I am Matt. Here's you'll find my ever growing collection of unfinished side projects. :smile:

## Recent Projects

Recently, I have been working on a [bus visualization tool](http://bus.mattschlosser.me) to easily visualize
bus data. Here's a snapshot.

My goal was to have an easy way to visualize the data between two different times. I started collecting data back in Feburary 2020, 
so I have been having fun comparing pre-pandemic levels of service with current ones.


## Testing Code Navigation 

```js
add_sumething(1,2);
// 3
```
