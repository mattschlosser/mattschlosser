# About Matt

Hi. I am Matt. Here's you'll find my ever growing collection of unfinished side projects. :smile:

## Recent Projects

### Electric Buses and Bus Data Visualization

#### Electric Buses

Recently, my city added a few electric buses to their fleet. I created a simple app/tool to easily locate
the bus, show which route it's on, give an approximate distance, and show the locations of the buses on a map.

Check it out at [bus.mattschlosser.me/electric](https://bus.mattschlosser.me/electric)

#### Bus Data Visualization 

Recently, I have been working on a [bus visualization tool](https://bus.mattschlosser.me) to easily visualize
bus data. Here's a snapshot.

My goal was to have an easy way to visualize the data between two different times. I started collecting data back in Feburary 2020, 
so I have been having fun comparing pre-pandemic levels of service with current ones.
