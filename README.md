# About Me

Hi. I am Matt. This is a test. 

## Recent Projects

Recently, I have been working on a [bus visualization tool](http://bus.mattschlosser.me) to easily visualize
bus data. Here's a snapshot. 

![A map](../../../bus/blob/master/docs/img/datavis1.png "TEST")

My goal was to have an easy way to visualize the data between two different times. I started collecting data back in Feburary 2020, 
so I have been having fun comparing pre-pandemic levels of service with current ones.


## Testing Code Navigation 

```js
const Oslo = require('oslo-events');
const oslo = new Oslo();
```
